              When everyone you thought you knew,<br>
              Deserts your fight, I'll go with you.<br>
              You're facing down a dark hall,<br>
              I'll grab my light, and go with you.<br><br>

              I'll go with you.<br><br>

              Surrounded and up against a wall,<br>
              I'll shred them all, and go with you.<br>
              When choices end, you must defend,<br>
              I'll grab my bat, and go with you.<br><br>

              Stay with me. No, you don't need to run.<br>
              Stay with me, my blood. You don't need to run.<br><br>

              If there comes a day,<br>
              People posted up at the end  your driveway,<br>
              They're calling for your head,<br>
              and they're calling for your name,<br>
              I'll bomb down  them, I'm coming through.<br>
              Do they know I was grown with you?<br>
              If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you,<br>
              Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah.<br><br>

              If you find yourself in a lion's den,<br>
              I'll jump right in and pull my pin, and go with you.
