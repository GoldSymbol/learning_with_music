              I ponder of something great<br>
              My lungs will fill and then deflate<br>
              They fill with fire<br>
              Exhale desire<br>
              I know it's dire<br>
              My time today<br><br>

              I have these thoughts<br>
              So often I ought<br>
              To replace that slot<br>
              With what I once bought<br>
              'Cause somebody stole<br>
              My car radio<br>
              And now I just sit in silence<br><br>

              Sometimes quiet is violent<br>
              I find it hard to hide it<br>
              My pride is no longer inside<br>
              It's on my sleeve<br>
              My skin will scream<br>
              Reminding me of<br>
              Who I killed inside my dream<br>
              I hate this car that I'm driving<br>
              There's no hiding for me<br>
              I'm forced to deal with what I feel<br>
              There is no distraction to mask what is real<br>
              I could pull the steering wheel<br><br>

              I have these thoughts<br>
              So often I ought<br>
              To replace that slot<br>
              With what I once bought<br>
              'Cause somebody stole<br>
              My car radio<br>
              And now I just sit in silence<br><br>

              I ponder of something terrifying<br>
              'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind<br>
              I find over the course of our human existence<br>
              One thing consists of consistence<br>
              And it's that we're all battling fear<br>
              Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here<br>
              Oh my,<br>
              Too deep<br>
              Please stop thinking<br>
              I liked it better when my car had sound<br><br>

              There are things we can do<br>
              But from the things that work there are only two<br>
              And from the two that we choose to do<br>
              Peace will win<br>
              And fear will lose<br>
              There's faith and there's sleep<br>
              We need to pick one please because<br>
              Faith is to be awake<br>
              And to be awake is for us to think<br>
              And for us to think is to be alive<br>
              And I will try with every rhyme<br>
              To come across like I am dying<br>
              To let you know you need to try to think<br><br>

              I have these thoughts<br>
              So often I ought<br>
              To replace that slot<br>
              With what I once bought<br>
              'Cause somebody stole<br>
